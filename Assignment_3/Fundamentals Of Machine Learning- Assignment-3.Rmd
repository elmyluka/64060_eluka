#B. From the pivot table it can be analysed that the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer is 44/44+479 = 0.0841.

#2. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1)  = (174/174+114) = 0.604
#3. P(Loan = 1) = (288/288+2712) = 0.096
#4. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) = (800/800+1912) = 0.294
#5. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0) = (1624/ 1624+1088) = 0.598
#6. P(Loan = 0) = (2712/ 2712+288) = 0.904


#E. Using the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1).
#(0.277 x 0.604 x 0.096) / (0.277 x 0.604 x 0.096) + (0.294 x 0.598 x 0.904) = 0.10

#F. On comparing the naive bayes probability value i.e. 0.10 with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B) i.e.0.0841 it can be noticed that both the values lie near to each other and also the naive bayes has a higher accurate estimate when compared to "B".

#G. Running Naive Bayes on the data
library(naivebayes)

n_bayes <- naive_bayes(Personal.Loan~Online+CreditCard,data=train.norm)
n_bayes

#The value obtained by running the Naive Bayes Model for the customer who is accepting the loan and using credit card plus being an online banking user is 0.10 which is equivalent to the value obtained in E.
